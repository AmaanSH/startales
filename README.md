This was a short visual novel I created with a small team for the Narrative Driven Jam #9. This placed #5 out of 74 entries. Our team consisted of myself as the programmer, an artist, a composer and a game designer. We had a total of 5 days to make the game.

This game incorporates a visual novel with some light puzzles inspired by The Longest Night.

# Story Synopsis
In a night of reminiscing, connect the stars to retell the story of how the band StarTales came to be.
